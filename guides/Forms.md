### Effective Form Design

All forms are 

comprised

 of 6 elements:

-   **Labels:**  Inform users what the corresponding input fields mean.
-   **Input fields:**  Enable users to provide information. Information can be entered through a variety of different input fields ranging from text fields, checkboxes, and many other types.
-   **Help text:**  Provides assistance on how to fill out a field. Help text is optional.
-   **Placeholder text:**  Hints at what goes into a field. Placeholder text is optional.
-   **Actions:**  Allow users to submit a form.
-   **Validation:**  Ensures the data submitted by the user conforms to acceptable parameters.
